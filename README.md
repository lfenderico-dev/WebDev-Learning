# Front-End web development learning repository

## A complete repository about basics of front-end development technologies that I used to learn.


This repository was used by myself to learn:
- HTML;
- CSS;
- Javascript;
- Vue.js;

My method to learn things is:
1. Watch reference/documentation.
2. Apply it with the reference beside me.
3. Apply the concept by myself.

In this repository you can also find:
- My personal roadmap to learn basics;
- Some little projects that I did to learn things;

## Here you can find the roadmaps for every technology:
